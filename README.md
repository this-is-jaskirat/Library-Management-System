# Library-Management-System
My First project in Core JAVA
Library Management System is an application for assisting a librarian in managing a book library in a university. The system would provide basic set of features to add/update members, add/update books, and manage check in specifications for the systems based on the clientâ€™s statement of need.

The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. 

The main feature of this system is that all the books available in the library can be displayed in a list so that students need not roam through the entire library to find a book. Additionally, the application effectively maintains the details of users/students to whom books have been issued; it also records the issued date and return date.
